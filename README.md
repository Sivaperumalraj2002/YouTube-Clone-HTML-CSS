A static clone of the YouTube homepage built purely with HTML and CSS — meant for practice, design/markup/layout replication, and honing front-end skills.

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Repository:** `YouTube-Clone-HTML-CSS` by *Sivaperumalraj2002* :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Purpose: To simulate the look and feel of YouTube’s homepage using only HTML & CSS. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 📂 Repository Structure

Here’s what the repo contains: :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

| Folder / File | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `index.html` | The main HTML file. It includes the overall structure of the page: header, sidebar, search bar, video thumbnails, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} |
| `styles/` | Folder containing CSS styles used to layout and style the page — spacing, colors, responsiveness (if any), typography, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} |
| `thumbnails/` | Images used in the video preview thumbnails mockups. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} |
| `icons/` | Icons used for menu, search, etc. (e.g. logo, sidebar icons) :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} |
| `channel-pictures/` | Channel profile picture mockups shown under video thumbnails. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} |

## ✅ What Works Well

- The layout is very close to YouTube’s: sidebar navigation, header with search, consistent grid of video cards.  
- Good use of images and icons for thumbnails; attention to visual details.  
- Clean folder structure separating styles, images, thumbnails etc. helps maintainability.  
- Pure front-end: no JS, no backend — which is good for focusing on design and CSS skills.

## ⚠️ Limitations / What’s Not Included

- No functional interactivity (e.g. search bar doesn’t work, links not real) — purely static.  
- Probably not responsive (if not already adapted for mobile/smaller screens).  
- No dynamic content (all markup is hardcoded).  
- No accessibility features noted (alt tags, ARIA, keyboard navigation) unless already added.

## 🚀 Possible Next Steps (Improvements)

Here are things you could add to take this project further:

1. **JavaScript Interactivity**  
   - Make search bar functional (maybe mock search).  
   - Clicking on a video thumbnail leads to a “video detail” page template.  

2. **Fetch Real Data / Use API**  
   - Integrate with YouTube API (or mock API) to pull video information dynamically.  

3. **Responsive Design**  
   - Ensure layout adapts nicely to mobile, tablet, desktop.  
   - Use media queries to rearrange sidebar, grid etc.  

4. **Accessibility Improvements**  
   - Add meaningful `alt` attributes for images.  
   - Use semantic HTML elements.  
   - Ensure high contrast for text.  

5. **Optimization**  
   - Optimize image sizes.  
   - Minify CSS.  

6. **Enhance Styling**  
   - Add hover effects, transitions.  
   - Dark mode / light mode switch.
